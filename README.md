# ksql-poc

POC of an app integrated with [ksqlDB](https://ksqldb.io). It follows the examples from the [Java API Client docs](https://docs.ksqldb.io/en/latest/developer-guide/ksqldb-clients/java-client/).

## Usage

There are 2 components: `base-resources` is responsible to create the stream and the table that will be used by the app
and preloading them with data; `emulate-app` is the app that will query data from `ksql`.

### From command line

```sh
lein base-resources

lein emulate-app
```

### From Intellij

There are scripts in the directory `.run` that allow you to run either components. You just need to choose one of them
from the dropdown menu and press play üõÄüèΩ.
